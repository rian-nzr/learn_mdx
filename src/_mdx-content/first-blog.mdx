# Getting Started with TypeScript

TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, making your code more robust and maintainable.

## Code Example

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

function greetUser(user: User): string {
  return `Hello, ${user.name}!`;
}
